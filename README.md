Created a disease identification system for nine distinct tomato plant diseases employing a convolutional neural network (CNN).
Utilized an online dataset of leaf images and implemented data augmentation techniques to enhance model training.
Achieved heightened accuracy and robustness by training the CNN on diverse variations of leaf images.
Developed a  model capable of accurately identifying and classifying various diseases affecting tomato plants.
